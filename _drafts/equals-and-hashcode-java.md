#General contract for `equals(Object)` and `hashCode()`

Very good article [How to Write an Equality Method in
Java](http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/equality.html]) written by Odersky
is diving deep into problems of `equals` and `hashCode`, so I will skip this.

I would rather focus on unit testing of equality.
